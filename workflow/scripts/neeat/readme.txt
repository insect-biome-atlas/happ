To apply the neeat filter, first make sure that the cluster counts file,
cluster taxonomy file and vsearch matchlist are reached by the functions
in the get_data_fxns.R script, which is used by the rest of the code.
These are big files that should be downloaded from the corresponding
figshare repos.

A few intermediate files are big and have to be regenerated by the 
generate_counts_files.R and generate_datasets.R scripts (see below).
The remaining downstream intermediate files are included in the github
repo so that they do not have to be regenerated if the focus is on
experimenting with some of the downstream steps in the workflow.

Then run the following scripts to generate the input files for the neeat filter:

1. generate_counts_files.R
2. generate_datasets.R (puts order-level datasets in the directory "../data/")
3. generate_aa_seqs.R (puts order-level aa seq files in the directory "../alignments")
3. align_seqs.sh (in "../alignments/") (aligns sequences using mafft and pal2nal)
4. generate_evodistlists.R (generates order-level evodistlist files in "../data/" for the evo_filter function of neeat)

Note that some files in "../data/" are too big for github, so this folder is not
under version control either; it must be generated using the above scripts.

After completing the above steps, all the data are ready for running or benchmarking neeat.

In benchmarking, we used the following scripts:
1. echo_filter.R
2. evo_filter.R
3. abundance_filter.R

These are combined in the neeat filter in the script 'neeat_filter.R'

Running tests with different parameter settings for
different components of the neeat algorithm is done
using scripts in "../runs".

Result files from benchmarking of neeat components and
neeat itself, and from testing abundance filtering, hmm
filtering and lulu filtering are in "../results/".

Raw intermediate results, which are reused for faster exploration
of the neeat parameter space, are in "../raw_results".

Similarly, raw results from hmm are in "../raw_hmm_results" and
raw results from lulu in "../raw_lulu_results".
